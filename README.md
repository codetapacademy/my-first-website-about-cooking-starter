# My first website about cooking - starter

Welcome to version two of the project **My first website about cooking**. This is the starter version and it's aimed for people that are starting their 1st website or are at the very beginning of their web developer career.

Consider joining our CodeTap Academy Discord server at https://discord.gg/xcmtRYV and ask for guidance or spend time with other web developers. All levels are welcomed, from day 1 starters to seniors and gurus.

While building this website you want to use only HTML and CSS. No other libraries are required or suggested.
As visual guidance you can open the _Android Mobile.pdf_, _Android Tablet.pdf_ and _Web.pdf_ or _Coding with My Husband - First Website.xd_ file from the _requirement_ folder. You can download and use the free version of [**Adobe Acrobat Reader**](https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/) to read the _pdf_ file or the free version of [**Adobe XD**](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) to open the _xd_ file.

You are also provided with an images and icons which can be found in `requirement/asset`. You should use the provided svg and image files. You can use the provided avatars or replace it with your own as long as it is a square shape (the width and height are the same) of 400px width and 400px height. You can use the provided recipe images or replace them with your own as long as they are 494px in width and 278px in height.

You want to leave alone all the provided files and folder structure and not make any changes with the exception of the `web` folder. All your work should be present in the `web` folder. So if you want to create any files and folder, you want to do it only inside the `web` folder. If you want to use images or svgs from the `requirement/asset` folder, copy them somewhere of your choice inside the `web` folder.

## How to start

### I am a student of CodeTap Academy?

If you are a student of **CodeTap Academy**, before you _fork_ the project, get in touch with your **mentor** or **mentor assistant** so they can create a _branch_ for you. Once this branch is created you can easily do _Pull Request_ to it.

You will get helped by your **mentor** and other students of **CodeTap Academy** if you do Pull Requests to your branch and also receive and enhanced recommendation from your mentor when future employers will request one.

### I am not a student of CodeTap Academy

You don't need to do any extra steps like the students of **CodeTap Academy**. Please proceed to creating a fork. Once the _fork_ process has created a copy of the project to your profile, use the big green **Clone** button to make a copy to your computer and proceed just like with any other project cloned from GitHub. That's it! Nothing else needs to be done, this is the final step. Have fun working on it.

### Create a fork and clone

You want to go to the [My first website about cooking - starter](https://github.com/codetapacademy/my-first-website-about-cooking-starter) project on GitHub and click the big **Fork** button to create a copy of it on your profile. The **Fork** button can be found at the top right corner of the page. Once the _fork_ process has created a copy of the project to your profile, use the big green **Clone** button to make a copy to your computer and proceed just like with any other project cloned from GitHub.

### Create branches (only for CodeTap students)

To start with you want to switch to your personalised branch created by your mentor or mentor assitant, like your first and last name, `marian-zburlea`.
Example: `git checkout marian-zburlea`

Once you have switched to your personalised branch you want to create your first branch out of it. 

In this project we have three sections: **cooking**, **team** and **contact**.
There should be three branches `marian-zburlea-cooking`, `marian-zburlea-team` and `marian-zburlea-contact` created by the and of the project. 

To create your first branch you can write `git checkout -b marian-zburlea-cooking`. Start solving the first section before creating your second and third branch. Once you have at least one or more changes in your newly created branch, you can create a _pull request_ to the original project. Make sure to create the PR against your personalised branch and not against the _master_ branch. Consider asking for help from your mentor, mentor assistant or other more experienced students if you run into trouble.

## Tips

If you have `NodeJS` installed consider installing one of the projects `live-server` or `lite-server`. For a beginner they do the same thing so flip a coin if you're unsure.
To install them you can run in the command line: `npm i -g live-server` or `npm i -g lite-server`.

Make sure that you're inside your `web` folder and you have at least `index.html` file inside it before starting a web server by running in the command line: `lite-server` or `live-server`.

To check your current path and make sure you are or you aren't in your `web` folder, you can **p**ing your **w**working **d**irectory by typing in your command line: `pwd`

## Good luck

I hope you'll enjoy this project and have fun while you're at it. Stay tuned for more projects to come and the tutorial for this one by following https://codetap.academy and consider subscribing as well. The next projects from this series will be:

* `My CV v2 - Junior` where we'll have fun using `pug-starter`
* `My CV v2 - Mid` where we'll have fun using `React`
* `My CV v2 - Senior` where we'll have fun using `React` and `NodeJS`
