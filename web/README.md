You can start by creating a `index.html` file and add a basic structure with `head` and `title`, `body` and some content.

Double click the `index.html` file to open it in a browser.

If you have `lite-server` or `live-server`, open a command line, make sure your path is at the `web` folder and just run `lite-server` or `live-server`.
